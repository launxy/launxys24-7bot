# launxys24-7bot
Minecraft bot that stays running, breking blocks and stuff when you order him to. Made for keeping your aternos server almost fully 24/7 (you can use it for whatever you want)

ATERNOS REQUIREMENTS:
-Switch your Aternos server version to Parer/Bukkit
-Enable ViaBackwards, ViaRewind and ViaVersion (this makes the server available for older Minecraft clients wich this bot uses)

WINDOWS REQUIREMENTS:
-Node.js

HOW TO RUN?
1. Edit with notepad bot.js to configure the Bot's name, server IP address and port
2. Save and close the file, then you can Right Click and "Run with PowerShell" start-bot.ps1

HOW TO USE
The bot haves 2 functions: 
-"circle" wich will make the bot do its own thing, running in circles and breaking stuff
-"stop" will make the bot stop inmediately 
It also includes 2 broken commands "Guard"  (doesnt do anything yet) and "sleep" wich will make the bot place a bed whenever you type "sleep" in the chat but is also broken. SOOOOOO I guess you cannot skip nights when the bot's online
